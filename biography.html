      <p>My paintings have been exhibited in London, at the Brick Lane Gallery and Gabriel Fine Art, and in the West Country at the First View Gallery, Stourhead.</p>
      <p>My art focuses on exploring and questioning the notion of wilderness.</p>
      <p>For many, wilderness is the last remaining place where civilization has not fully intruded. Regarded in this way, wilderness exists as a finite notion, the best antidote to our human selves, an isle in the contaminated sea of modernity, a refuge.</p>
      <p>But is it? This is the central question of my work. </p>
      <p>The more one knows of the history of wilderness, the more one realizes that wilderness is not a finite concept. My work explores the significance of wilderness as a cultural product of the assumption that humans and nature are separate. The work explores the boundaries between the self and the rest of nature. </p>
      <p>I draw stylistically from the painters of the sublime, while simultaneously contradicting much of their understanding of wilderness. I manipulate wilderness scenes, exploring the human projection of fantasy and timelessness onto non-human or less human landscapes that underpin the notion of wilderness. My paintings appear to resonate with many who have an interest in landscape and culture. One such being the commentator Robert Macfarlane, with whose kind words (and permission) I conclude:</p>
      <div style="display: flex; margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw;">
        <p class = "quote" >“I like the collision of memory, fantasy and topo-reality: …. modest human interventions, records of route and story, but acknowledgement of the sublime. And I like, too, [Sholto’s] smudging of date as well as place; one thinks of Turner and de Loutherbourg, yes, but there is also a modern and distinctive idiom visibly at work.”</p>
