        <p>Sholto Blissett (b.1996) is an artist from Salisbury who lives and works in London. He read Geography at the University of Durham before undertaking an MA in painting at the Royal College of Art, London. Sholto has recently exhibited with Unit 1 Gallery and the White Cube, and is currently making work as part of the 'Future Archive RCA' project led by photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg.</p>
        <p>Growing up surrounded by the ancient sites of Stonehenge and Avebury stone circle, Sholto has always had an interest in the fictions which societies create in an attempt to understand their place in nature. Hence, Sholto’s largescale, fictional landscapes explore humankind’s relation to nature. At first glance, he evokes the Kantian division of the human and nonhuman; yet his works then turn the viewer towards the Sublime realisation that these two notions are indivisible. Thus, the original, Kantian conception of the Sublime in which the human and natural are purported as separate are challenged by the alternative arguments emerging from the events of the Anthropocene. Sholto encourages the viewer to realise their – our – inescapable intertwinement with the natural world.</p>

        <p>Sholto Blissett’s paintings, which focus on exploring and questioning the notion of wilderness and boundaries, have been exhibited in galleries in London.</p>
        <p>For many, wilderness is the last remaining place where civilization has not fully intruded. Regarded in this way, wilderness exists as a finite notion, the best antidote to our human selves, an isle in the contaminated sea of modernity; a refuge.</p>
        <p><i>But is it</i>. This is the central question of Sholto’s work.</p>
        <p>With a degree in Geography (University of Durham), and having travelled extensively from the Arctic to the Far East, Sholto believes the more one knows of the history of wilderness, the more it becomes evident that wilderness is not a finite concept. His works instead explore wilderness as a cultural product arising out of the assumption that humans and nature are separate. They also investigate the boundaries between the self and the rest of nature.</p>
        <p>Stylistically, Sholto’s work draws from the painters of the Sublime, while simultaneously contradicting much of their understanding of wilderness. He manipulates wilderness scenes, examining the human projection of fantasy and timelessness onto non-human, or less human, landscapes that underpin the notion of wilderness.</p>
        <p>Sholto’s paintings resonate with many who have an interest in landscape and culture. Author of <i>The Old Ways</i>, <i>The Wild Places</i> and <i>Landmarks</i>, Robert Macfarlane, Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, has written in response to Sholto’s work:</p>
        <p></p>
        <div style="display: flex; margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw;">
          <p class = "quote">“I like the collision of memory, fantasy and topo-reality: …. modest human interventions, records of route and story, but acknowledgement of the sublime. And I like, too, [Sholto’s] smudging of date as well as place; one thinks of Turner and de Loutherbourg, yes, but there is also a modern and distinctive idiom visibly at work.”</p>
